## Overview
we begin our JavaScript journey by looking into its technical aspects and how it applies to the field of data analytics and visualization
In this module, you'll build a table using data stored in a JavaScript array. You'll also create filters to make this table fully dynamic, meaning that it will react to user input, and then place the table into an HTML file for easy viewing.

You'll customize your webpage using Bootstrap, and equip your table with several fully functional filters that will allow users to interact with our visualizations. Watch the video to learn more about the specific data project you'll be working on.
