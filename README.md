### Overview of the analysis:
In this module, I'll build a table using data stored in a JavaScript array, also applying filters to make the table fully dynamic and then place the table into an HTML file for easy viewing. Using bootstrap I'll be able to customize the webpage with the table being equip with several fully functional filters that will allow users to interact with the visualizations.
